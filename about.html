            <p>Ocean Protection is a corporation that aims to reduce the atrocities done on poor sea creatures by our devastating impacts that can even be lethal to those poor creatures.
               As global citizens, have we humans kept any equality between us and sea creatures destroying their homeland. We have taken the world for granted!
            Constantly throwing garbage and rubbish in the oceans, on the road everywhere polluting the area, but what do you care, after all we're all too lazy. But for once, don't think about 
        yourself, instead do it for the sake of these fascinating creatures to survive so that our future generations can see them and that they don't go extinct.</p>

            <p>Throwing our waste in the oceans has had more devastating impacts than you've expected. 8 million tonnes of plastic which is estimated to be 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic are thrown into
                our ocean every year. Out of this multitude of plastic thrown into the ocean each year, the amount of sea creatures that die due to these pieces of plastci are only those we can find on the surface
                in our day-to-day lives. Imagine, if the 100,100,000 sea creatures that die each year is only those we can find, how many sea creatures altogehter are going affected that we don't even know about.
                It is about time we take responsibility for our actions.
